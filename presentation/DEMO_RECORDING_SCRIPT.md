"Welcome to Digital Homes - the world's first AI-powered fractionalized real estate investment platform built on Andromeda Protocol.

### Problem & Solution (45 seconds)
**[Show landing page hero section]**

"Traditional real estate investment has three major problems: high barriers requiring hundreds of thousands of dollars, zero liquidity once you invest, and outdated valuations based on 6-month-old appraisals.

Digital Homes solves all three. We tokenize properties using Andromeda's smart contracts, enable fractional ownership starting at $100, provide instant trading liquidity, and use AI for real-time property valuations."

### Property Discovery (60 seconds)
**[Navigate to Properties page]**

"Let's explore our marketplace. Here you see properties with AI-powered valuations and confidence scores.

This Beverly Hills luxury apartment - our AI values it at $487,000 with 92% confidence. The AI analyzed square footage, neighborhood data, school ratings, crime rates, and current market trends.

Notice it's tokenized into 10,000 shares at $48.70 each. You can invest with as little as one share - just $48.70 to own part of a Beverly Hills property."

### AI Valuation Deep Dive (45 seconds)
