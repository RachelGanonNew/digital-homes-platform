*Duration: 5-7 minutes*

## Opening Hook (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Digital Homes landing page]**

"What if you could own a piece of a $2 million Beverly Hills property for just $100? What if AI could tell you exactly what that property is worth in real-time? And what if you could trade your ownership instantly, like a stock?

Welcome to Digital Homes - the world's first AI-powered fractionalized real estate investment platform built on the Andromeda Protocol."

## Problem Statement (45 seconds)
**[Screen: Traditional real estate problems visualization]**

"Traditional real estate investment has three major problems:

First, HIGH BARRIERS TO ENTRY. You need hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest in premium properties.

Second, ZERO LIQUIDITY. Once you buy, you're stuck for years. You can't easily sell your investment.

Third, OPAQUE VALUATIONS. Property values are based on outdated appraisals, not real-time market data.

These problems exclude 99% of people from the world's largest asset class - a $280 trillion market."

## Solution Overview (60 seconds)

"Digital Homes solves all three problems with breakthrough technology:

PROBLEM 2 - NO LIQUIDITY: Our marketplace lets you trade property shares instantly, like stocks. Buy and sell anytime.

PROBLEM 3 - OUTDATED VALUATIONS: Our AI analyzes 13+ data points in real-time - from neighborhood scores to economic indicators - giving you accurate, up-to-the-minute property values."
